# What is an ORM?

  An Object Relational Mapping tool allows us to use a particular language that we like (in our case Ruby) to model objects, but still use a database for persistence.

## Our goals:
 - build out a single class that persists data to a database
 - extract common functionality from that class to a super class

## CRUD
 - initialize
 - save
 - find
 - find_by
 - update
 - delete
